# EDA-in-a-real-business-scenario
This case study aims to give us an idea of applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques that we have learnt in the EDA module, we will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
